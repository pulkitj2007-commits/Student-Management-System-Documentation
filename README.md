# Student Management System (Python)

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Student Management System** is a Python-based application designed to manage student records efficiently.  
It allows storing, updating, searching, deleting, and displaying student information such as Name, Roll Number, Class, and Marks.  
This project follows a structured development process and uses core Python concepts like functions, file handling, loops, and conditional logic.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify and solve a real-world problem of managing student records manually.
- Build a simple digital system to store student details safely.
- Apply programming concepts learned in the course, including:
  - Top-Down design & modular programming
  - Algorithms & flow control
  - File handling (JSON/CSV)
  - Testing & refinement

---

## 🧠 Key Features
| Feature | Description |
|--------|------------|
| Add Student | Add new student details to database |
| View Students | Display all stored records |
| Search Student | Search using roll number |
| Update Student | Modify existing student information |
| Delete Student | Remove a student record |
| Save Data | Stores information using JSON/CSV file |

## 🔧 Development Process
### ✔ Problem Definition
Manual handling of student records is time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to manage.

### ✔ Requirement Analysis
- Store and manage student data digitally
- Functions for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Safe & permanent data storage

### ✔ Design Approach (Top-Down)


Main Menu
├── Add Student
├── View Students
├── Search Student
├── Update Student
└── Delete Student


### ✔ Algorithm (Example: Add Student)
1. Input student details
2. Store details in dictionary
3. Load existing JSON file
4. Append new record
5. Save updated list back to file
6. Display success message
